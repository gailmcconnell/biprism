Python code to calculate the difference in contrast with and without a lens-coupled biprism in the optical path of a stereomicroscope. This is accompanied by raw and normalised data for use with the code, Fishscale.xlsx. 

Data relates to publication "A large 3D-printed lens-coupled biprism enhances contrast in transmission stereomicroscopy", submitted to Biorxiv in April 2025.
